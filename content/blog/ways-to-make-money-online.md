The [history](/blog/history) of earning money online traces back decades. The first money made online by a "normal person" is a fascinating story that reflects the transformative power of the internet. While there isn't a single definitive account due to the internet's decentralized nature and the countless transactions that have occurred, there are several notable instances that illustrate this milestone.

One such story involves a man named Gary Thuerk, who is often credited with sending the first unsolicited mass email, or spam, in 1978.

This transaction marked a significant milestone in the history of online commerce, showcasing the feasibility and convenience of purchasing goods over the internet.

These early examples demonstrate how ordinary individuals, armed with innovative ideas and access to the internet, were able to generate revenue and participate in online commerce. Over time, the internet has evolved into a vast ecosystem that has democratized entrepreneurship and commerce, empowering countless individuals to pursue their passions and create economic opportunities in ways that were previously unimaginable.
