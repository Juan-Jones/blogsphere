## What is Google Adsense

Google AdSense, a program developed by Google, serves as an advertising platform that enables website owners and content creators to display targeted ads on their digital properties.

Companies or individuals offer a specific amount which they will pay per click to the Adwords program. They have two options, Pay Per Click (PPC) or Pay Per Impression (PPI).

- PPI Model: In the pay-per-impression model, earnings are based on the number of times the ad is displayed (per thousand impressions). Website owners receive revenue for every thousand impressions, regardless of clicks.

First: The publisher (you) signs up for a Google Adsense account.
Next: An advertiser pays Google for clicks or impressions.
Then: The team gives you a code to place on your site.
Finally: Google pays the publisher (you) per click or per impression.
