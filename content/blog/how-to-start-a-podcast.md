Below is a step-by-step guide on _how to start a podcast_:

When are you planning to launch your podcast? Why are you launching a podcast? Where do you picture your platform five years from now? Answering these basic questions will help you identify a concept and a vision for your podcast.

- Educational podcasts – Typically, the educational podcast is niche-related. The content teaches the audience about a specific topic.

### 3. Name Your Podcast

There are a few options you can use to name your podcast. The first and most popular option is to include keywords in the title. So if your podcast is about cooking, you could name your platform “The Cooking Show”. The second option is to choose a catchy phrase, something that the audience will remember.

### 5. Get a Domain Name

Sponsorships typically involve agreements where podcasters receive payment based on predefined terms, such as a fixed fee per episode or a percentage of sales generated through unique promotional codes provided to listeners.


## How Much Money Do Podcasts Make?

The amount of money a podcast generates depends on the social following. Platforms with a few followers will not earn as much revenue as platforms that have a larger amount of social followers.

In 2019, businesses spent $514 million on podcast ads. According to data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and PwC, in 2021, experts expect ad revenue to exceed $1 billion dollars.

There is not a minimum or maximum amount of money a podcast can produce. Podcasting is not like a typical 9- 5 job where employees get paid a certain amount weekly. Here are the top 3 podcasters:

- Joe Rogan Experience ($900,000 monthly).
- Chapo Trap House ($153,000 monthly).
- Smart Passive Income ($100,000 monthly).

Indeed, it will be cheaper to record the content, but it will require most of your time.
