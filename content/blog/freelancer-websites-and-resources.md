Darren Rowse launched ProBlogger in 2004 I would consider ProBlogger a site created by the people for the people. The developer of ProBlogger put more of a personal touch on this company, unlike other sites in this marketplace. Mr. Rowse launched this platform based on his experience. His aim was to help marketers, whereas groups of developers developed other sites in this marketplace for profit maximization. ProBlogger is the cheapest site to hire freelancers.
